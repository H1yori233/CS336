    "Write a benchmarking script using `triton.testing.do_bench` that compares the performance of your (partially) Triton implementation of FlashAttention-2 forward and backward passes with a regular PyTorch implementation (i.e., not using FlashAttention). Specifically, you will report a table that includes latencies for forward, backward, and the end-to-end forward-backward pass, for both your Triton and PyTorch implementations. Randomly generate any necessary inputs before you start benchmarking, and run the benchmark on a single H100. Always use batch size 1 and causal masking. Sweep over the cartesian product of sequence lengths of various powers of 2 from 128 up to 65536, embedding dimension sizes of various powers of 2 from 16 up to size 128, and precisions of `torch.bfloat16` and `torch.float32`. You will likely need to adjust tile sizes depending on the input sizes.\n",

    "(a) Create a script to profile the peak memory usage when training language models with and without optimizer state sharding. Using the standard configuration (1 node, 2 GPUs, XL model size), report the peak memory usage after model initialization, directly before the optimizer step, and directly after the optimizer step. Do the results align with your expectations? Break down the memory usage in each setting (e.g., how much memory for parameters, how much for optimizer states, etc.).\n",
